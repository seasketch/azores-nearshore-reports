This report can be used to inform which key species' habitats would be protected by this plan. The higher the percentage, the greater the protection of these species.</p><p>üéØ Planning Objective: there is no specific objective/target for key species habitat.</p><p>üó∫Ô∏è Source Data: The species distribution models (SDMs) used in this report are from the Ara√∫jo Lab. SDMs model probability of presence of individual species in a given area. While these SDMs are based partly on collected observational data, they are models and thus have baked-in uncertainty.</p><p>üìà Report: Percentages are calculated by taking the total area of the species' distribution within the MPAs in this plan, and dividing it by the total area of the species' distribution in the nearshore. If the plan includes multiple areas that overlap, the overlap is only counted once.</p>",
